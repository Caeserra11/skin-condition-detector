# Skin Condition Detector ðŸ©º

A Gradio-based web app for detecting skin conditions (Eczema/Normal) using the HAM10000 dataset.  
**Developed in Google Colab** â†’ [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/repo-name/blob/main/skin_detector.ipynb)

## Features
- Image classification with a CNN model
- Simple Gradio interface
- HAM10000 dataset adaptation

## How It Was Built
- **Environment**: Google Colab (GPU runtime)  
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Interface**: Gradio  

## Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
