A simple Gradio web app that **analyzes skin images** and predicts conditions like eczema or acne.  

## **Features** ✨  
- Upload a skin image for analysis  
- **Mock predictions** (ready for real ML model integration)  
- User-friendly interface  

## **How to Run** 🚀  
1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skin-condition-detector.git
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:
